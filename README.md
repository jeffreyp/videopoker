Current status: playable. After some initial challenges keeping score correctly, it seems to work now. Clone the repo, `npm start` in its directory, and hit http://localhost:3000.

**A note about this commit ID: https://github.com/jeffreyp/videopoker/commit/626d7b2c829d474262dfbcd9d95d343e971f7d82:** I paid $5 to Claude Sonnet 3.5 V2 via the amazing Cline VS Code plugin, and made it do all of this work for me. You'll see in the diff for that commit that Claude even saw fit to remove my awesome debugging statements from my prior attempts to fix the scorekeeping bugs.
